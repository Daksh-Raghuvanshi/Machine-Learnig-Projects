## Machine Learning Projects Crate

This repository contains a collection of basic Machine Learning projects that I have implemented to improve my understanding of the field.

### Projects
Each project has its own directory within the repository and contains all the necessary files to run the code. The README file within each project directory provides additional information about the project, including the data used, the methodology, and the results.

### Requirements
To run these projects, you will need to have the following software installed:

Python 3 (version 3.10.2)

Jupyter Notebook 

Additional libraries used in the projects (e.g. pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)


### Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

**git clone https://github.com/Daksh-Raghuvanshi/Machine-Learnig-Projects.git**

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory you are interested in and open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the code and reproduce the results.
